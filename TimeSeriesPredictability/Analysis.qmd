Most of time series analyses start with investigating series,
autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots. Then one estimates
different time series models (like ARIMA, GARCH, State-space models) and
performs model checks.

But no one asks whether that series is predictable or not.

We'll look at a few handy tools that give more information about our
time series.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

library(DChaos)
library(statcomp)
library(pracma)
library(tseriesChaos)
library(vrtest)
library(DFA)
library(nonlinearTseries)
library(TSstudio)
```

## Data

We'll use some example time series:

-   Monthly Airline Passenger Numbers 1949-1960 (AirPassengers) \[6\]

    ```{r}
    data(AirPassengers)
    ts_plot(AirPassengers)
    ```

-   Level of Lake Huron 1875-1972 (LakeHuron) \[6\]

    ```{r}
    data(LakeHuron)
    ts_plot(LakeHuron)
    ```

-   Simulated time-series data from the Logistic map with chaos \[1\]

    ```{r}
    LogisticTs <- logistic.sim(a=3.6, s=0.5, n=100)
    ts_plot(LogisticTs)
    ```

    Let's look the tools.

## Lyapunov Exponent

Lyapunov exponent of a dynamical system is a quantity that characterizes
the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories.
Quantitatively, two trajectories in phase space with initial separation
vector $\delta Z_0$ diverge at a rate given by

$$
|\delta Z(t)|\approx e^{\lambda t}|\delta Z_0|
$$

where $\lambda$ is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation can be
different for different orientations of initial separation vector. Thus,
there is a spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. It is common to refer to the
largest one as the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE), because it
determines a notion of predictability for a dynamical system \[7\].

I'll not go into detail on how to calculate the maximal Lyapunov
exponent, we'll look at practical implications.

A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is
chaotic \[7\].

## Hurst Exponent

The Hurst exponent is referred to as the "index of dependence" or "index
of long-range dependence". It quantifies the relative tendency of a time
series either to regress strongly to the mean or to cluster in a
direction:

-   Trending (Persistent) series: If $0.5 < H \leq 1$ , then series has
    long-term positive autocorrelation, so a high value in the series
    will probably be followed by another high value and the future will
    also tend to be high;

-   Random walk series: if $H = 0.5$, then series is a completely
    uncorrelated series, so it can go either way (up or down);

-   Mean-reverting (Anti-persistent) series: if $0 \leq H < 0.5$, then
    series has mean-reversion, so a high value in the series will
    probably be followed by a low value and vice versa \[8\].

## Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

DFA is a method for determining the statistical self-affinity of a
signal. It is the generalization of Hurst exponent, it means \[10\]:

-   for $0<\alpha<0.5$, then the series is anti-correlated;

-   for $\alpha=0.5$, then the series is uncorrelated and corresponds to
    white noise;

-   for $0.5<\alpha<1$, then the series is correlated;

-   for $\alpha\approx1$, then the series corresponds to pink noise;

-   for $\alpha>1$, then the series is nonstationary and unbounded;

-   for $\alpha\approx1.5$, then the series corresponds to Brownian
    noise.

## Variance Ratio Test

This test is often used to test the hypothesis that a given time series
is a collection of i.i.d. observations or that it follows a martingale
difference sequence.

We will use Chow and Denning's multiple variance ratio test. There are two tests:

* CD1 - Test for i.i.d. series,
* CD2 - Test for uncorrelated series with possible heteroskedasticity.

If test statistics are bigger than critical values, the null hypothesis is 
rejected which means the series is not a random walk.

## Statistics of the series

### AirPassengers data

```{r include=FALSE}
lya_air = lyapunov(AirPassengers)
hur_air = hurstexp(AirPassengers, display = FALSE)
dfa_air = dfa(AirPassengers)
est_air = estimate(dfa_air, do.plot = FALSE)

holding_per = round(Auto.VR(AirPassengers)$stat)
vrt_air = Chow.Denning(AirPassengers, c(2,4,5,8,10,holding_per))
```

Results:

-   Lyapunov exponent spectrum:

    ```{r}
    summary(lya_air)
    ```

    There are two statistically significant exponent estimates. The
    largest one is -0.84 which is negative, which means the series is
    not chaotic.

-   Hurst exponent is `r hur_air$Hs`; it is bigger than 0.5, so series
    is trending.

-   DFA is estimated as `r est_air[1]`; it is nonstationary and
    unbounded.

-   Variance ratio test:

    ```{r}
    vrt_air
    ```
    Both of test statistics are bigger than critical values, so the series is 
    not a random walk.

### LakeHuron data

```{r include=FALSE}
lya_lak = lyapunov(LakeHuron)
hur_lak = hurstexp(LakeHuron, display = FALSE)
dfa_lak = dfa(LakeHuron)
est_lak = estimate(dfa_lak, do.plot = FALSE)

holding_per2 = round(Auto.VR(LakeHuron)$stat)
vrt_lak = Chow.Denning(LakeHuron, c(2,4,5,8,10,holding_per2))
```

Results:

-   Lyapunov exponent spectrum:

    ```{r}
    summary(lya_lak)
    ```

    There are four statistically significant exponent estimates. The
    largest one is -0.22 which is negative, which means the series is
    not chaotic.

-   Hurst exponent is `r hur_lak$Hs`; it is bigger than 0.5, so series
    is trending.

-   DFA is estimated as `r est_lak[1]`; it is nonstationary and
    unbounded.

-   Variance ratio test:

    ```{r}
    vrt_lak
    ```
    
    Both of test statistics are bigger than critical values, so the series is 
    not a random walk.
    
### Simulated time-series data from the Logistic map with chaos

```{r include=FALSE}
lya_log = lyapunov(LogisticTs)
hur_log = hurstexp(LogisticTs, display = FALSE)
dfa_log = dfa(LogisticTs)
est_log = estimate(dfa_log, do.plot = FALSE)

holding_per3 = round(Auto.VR(LogisticTs)$stat)
vrt_log = Chow.Denning(LogisticTs, c(2,4,5,8,10,holding_per3))
```

Results:

-   Lyapunov exponent spectrum:

    ```{r}
    summary(lya_log)
    ```

    There is one statistically significant exponent estimate, -1.29 which is negative, which means the series is
    not chaotic which is a questionable result.

-   Hurst exponent is `r hur_log$Hs`; it is bigger than 0.5, so series
    is trending.

-   DFA is estimated as `r est_log[1]`; it is correlated.

-   Variance ratio test:

    ```{r}
    vrt_log
    ```
    
    Both of test statistics are smaller than critical values, so the series is 
    a random walk.
