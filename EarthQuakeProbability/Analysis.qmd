# Visualization of earthquake data

Let's look and visualize the historical earthquake data.

```{r}
data_with_coordinates
```

![](images/paste-FACE8B18.png)

```{r include=FALSE}
tm_shape(tur_shp) + tm_fill() + tm_shape(spdf) + tm_dots(size=0.5, col = "magnitude", alpha=0.4)
```

## Time Span between Earthquake Occurrences

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
p <- ggplot(data_diff_between_eq, aes(x=diff)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) + geom_density() +  theme(plot.background = element_rect(colour="#E5E4CE",fill="#E5E4CE",size=1))
p
```

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
p2 <- ggplot(data_diff_between_eq, aes(x=diff)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(plot.background = element_rect(colour="#E5E4CE",fill="#E5E4CE",size=1))
p2
```

## Earthquake Count By Year

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
p3 <- ggplot(data_count_by_year, aes(x=year, y=count)) + geom_line() + theme(plot.background = element_rect(colour="#E5E4CE",fill="#E5E4CE",size=1))
p3
```

# Modelling the probability

Let's fit Weibull distribution to distribution of days between two
earthquakes occurred successively.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
par(bg="#E5E4CE")
plotdist(data_diff_between_eq$diff, demp = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
descdist(data_diff_between_eq$diff, boot = 10000)
```

Fit the distribution:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
# add all data points to 0.1 for avoiding zero division errors
data_diff_between_eq$diff <- data_diff_between_eq$diff + 0.01

wei.fit <- fitdist(data_diff_between_eq$diff, "weibull")
```

Check convergence, 0 means procedure was converged:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
print(wei.fit$convergence)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
lapply(wei.fit, knitr::kable)
```

Results:

-   Estimate

    |       | x           |         sd |
    |:------|-------------|-----------:|
    | shape | 0.3647605   |  0.0294541 |
    | scale | 124.4717945 | 34.3619153 |

-   Fit quality:

    |        |     value |
    |:-------|----------:|
    | loglik | -618.5651 |
    | aic    |   1241.13 |
    | bic    |  1246.494 |

-   Plots:

    ```{r}
    par(bg="#E5E4CE")
    plot(wei.fit)
    ```

Let's calculate mean occurence period of earthquakes which have
magnitudes equal or bigger than 5 (simulation and theoretical mean):

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
shape.v <- as.numeric(wei.fit$estimate[1])
scale.v <- as.numeric(wei.fit$estimate[2])

simulated_data <- rweibull(100000, shape = shape.v, scale = scale.v)
```

|                  |                                  value |
|:-----------------|---------------------------------------:|
| Simulated mean   |               `r mean(simulated_data)` |
| Theoretical mean | `r scale.v * gamma(1 + (1 / shape.v))` |

It is expected to have another earthquake having magnitude equal to 5 or
above are average `r round(scale.v * gamma(1 + (1 / shape.v)))` days
later than the preceding one.

Let's plot the CDF:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
par(bg="#E5E4CE")
plot(ecdf(simulated_data), xlim=c(0, 6000))
```

If we look the data, the last earthquake was occurred at 2006-10-24, so
5753 days passed since last earthquake was occurred. The risk of an
earthquake happening today is
`r round(ecdf(simulated_data)(5753), digits=2)*100` %.
